(a)	Proprietary Information. During the term of this Agreement and following its termination, except as provided herein, the Service Provider agrees on behalf of itself, its affiliated entities and personnel, and its agents and personnel (including without limitation, directors, officers, employees, members, and partners) to treat confidentially and as proprietary (i) all records and other information related to the DAO and prior, present, or potential investors of the DAO (and clients of said investors), including, without limitation, the identity of such prior, present, or potential investors, as well as investment strategies and portfolio positions; and (ii) all terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Governing Documents (except to the extent otherwise consented to by the DAO in writing or  disclosed via the DAO’s Dapp), and agrees to protect all such records and information using commercially reasonable efforts.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Service Provider may, without prior notice to the DAO, process information related to the DAO’s Members (along with the Members’ beneficial owners, and/or control persons) and such other persons and entities as it deems appropriate through an OFAC, FinCEN, or other database, pursuant to the Service Provider’s procedures pertaining to client and investor identification, verification, and record keeping in accordance with applicable law.
