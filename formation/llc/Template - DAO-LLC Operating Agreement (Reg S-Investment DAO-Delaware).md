(i)	Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Subscription Agreement, or the Delaware Act, the parties agree and acknowledge that no Member (or former Member) shall be liable for the obligations of the  DAO for any amounts in excess of the amount of its capital contributions to the DAO (or the amount of capital contributions that were required to be made to the DAO, if greater), plus such Member’s share of the undistributed profits of the DAO, plus, to the extent required by law, or as otherwise described in this Agreement, any amounts distributed by the DAO to such Member; provided, that the foregoing shall not be construed in any way to alleviate a Member’s obligations to the DAO, including any obligations owed by such Member in connection with any breach of this Agreement or the Subscription Agreement by such  Member.

(ii)	Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, to satisfy any liability of the DAO, each Member or former Member shall, as determined by the Members acting by Majority Vote, and on not less than ten (10) Business Days’ advance written notice, be required to return distributions up to, but in no event in excess of, the aggregate amount of distributions actually received by each such Member from the DAO (less any such amounts already recalled  and not redistributed); provided, that the Members may not require such returns of distributed amounts after the third (3rd) anniversary of the final liquidating distribution of the DAO, unless the Members previously have been notified prior to such third (3rd) anniversary of the potential for such return.

(d)	No Control of the DAO. No Member shall have the right or power to: (a) cause the dissolution and winding up of the DAO; or (b) demand or receive property, other than cash, in return for its Capital Committments, except as otherwise provided herein.

(e)	Admission of Additional Members; Increase of Capital Commitments.

(i)	Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 3.f, the Members are authorized, but not obligated, to accept additional Capital Commitments from one or more Members, and to admit other Persons to the DAO as additional Members (each such additional Member, and such existing Member with respect to an increase in its Capital Commitment, an "Additional Member"). Unless otherwise determined by the Members, any such additional Capital Commitments shall be accepted, and any such Additional Members shall be admitted to the DAO, only if such Member or Additional Member contributes, on the date of its additional Capital Commitment or admission to the DAO, capital contributions equal to the full amount of its Capital Commitment or the increase in its Capital Commitment, as applicable. All Members admitted via the Dapp and underlying smart contracts prior to this Agreement shall be considered Members. For Additional Members, each Additional Member shall be deemed a Member on the date the Additional Member’s Ethereum address is whitelisted and processed pursuant to the DAO’s underlying smart contracts and governance process.

(ii)	Accession to Agreement. Each Person who is to be admitted as an additional or substitute Member pursuant to this Agreement shall agree to be bound by this Agreement by executing a counterpart signature page to this Agreement providing for such admission or a Subscription Agreement to such effect.

(iii)	Participation in Investments.   Each Additional Member shall participate in all DAO Investments made at or prior to its admission, subject to the DAO’s governance process. Following the permitted withdrawal of all of a Member’s Undeployed Capital pursuant to Section 7.a, such Member shall not participate in any DAO Investments made on or after such Withdrawal Date.

(f)	Maximum Ownership Percentage. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Member shall be permitted to have a Capital Commitment in excess of [__] of all then- current Capital Commitments to the DAO (the "Ownership Percentage Restriction"). The Service Provider is hereby authorized (but not required) to take any action it determines in good faith to be necessary, desirable, or appropriate in order that the Ownership Percentage Restriction not be violated with respect to any Member, including, without limitation:

(i)	canceling or reducing the Capital Commitment of any Member; and/or

(ii)	requiring the sale, in whole or in part, of any Member’s Units in the DAO, or otherwise requiring the withdrawal, in whole or in part, of any Member from the DAO.

(h)	Benefit Plan Investors. Prior to the closing date of the DAO’s initial DAO Investment, the Service Provider may, in its sole and absolute discretion, cause any capital contributions effected by "benefit plan investors" (within the meaning of Section 3(42) of Title I of ERISA) to be paid into an escrow account, including, without limitation, such portions of the capital contributions as may be attributable to any such Member’s pro rata portion of Service Provider Fees and DAO Expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, the Members intend (i) to limit equity participation by "benefit plan investors" to less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total value of each class of equity interests in the DAO; or (ii) to structure investments of the DAO and operate the DAO in such a manner so as to qualify the DAO as a "venture capital operating company" so that the underlying assets of the DAO should not constitute "plan assets" of "benefit plan investors."

(i)	The DAO shall delegate certain administrative responsibilities to Service Providers, pursuant to the terms of a certain Service Provider Agreement as applicable.

(b)	Member Identification and Approval of Investments.

(i)	Any Member (the "Proposing Member") that identifies a potential investment opportunity for the DAO (a "Potential DAO Investment") shall propose to the other Members the opportunity to invest in such investment opportunity through the Dapp.

(ii)	The Proposing Member shall notify the other Members of the opportunity to invest in the Potential DAO Investment through the Dapp and shall provide to the other Members sufficient information to assess the DAO Investment (the "Potential DAO Investment Notice"). Such Potential DAO Investment Notice shall be delivered to such other Members through the Dapp. If Members acting by the voting mechanism provided by the Dapp and the underlying DAO smart contracts elect to invest in such Potential DAO Investment within four (4) days following delivery of the Potential DAO Investment Notice, then the DAO shall invest in such Potential DAO Investment. Such approval shall be communicated to the Proposing Member and the other Members through the Dapp.

(iii)	If a Potential DAO Investment has been approved in accordance with Section 5.b.ii, then the DAO shall invest in such opportunity and each then-current Member (other than a Member that has permissibly withdrawn all of its Undeployed Capital in accordance with Section 7.a) shall participate in such DAO Investment on a pro rata basis, based on the relative Units of such Members. For the avoidance of doubt, every then-current Member (other than a Member that has permissibly withdrawn all of its Undeployed Capital in accordance with Section 7.a) shall participate in each Potential DAO Investment that has been approved in accordance with 5.b.ii, regardless of whether such Member voted in favor of such investment. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.b.iii to the contrary, a Member may be relieved of its obligation to participate in a DAO Investment if, in the sole  and absolute discretion of the applicable Service Provider(s), such participation would cause such Member to violate any law or regulation applicable to such Member.

(d)	Limitation on Borrowing. The DAO does not intend to employ leverage or borrow money, unless otherwise agreed to by the Members via a vote occurring through the Dapp.

(e)	Valuation. The calculation of the value of any DAO assets or DAO Investments shall be made by the DAO in its sole and absolute discretion (taking into account factors that reasonably might affect the sales price of the asset in question, including, without limitation, if and as appropriate,
 
any arm’s-length transaction involving unrelated parties and substantially similar securities of the same portfolio company, the existence of a control block, the lack of a market for such asset, the appropriateness of a discount with respect to the disposition of significant positions involving marketable securities, and the impact on present value of factors such as the length of time before any such sales may   become possible and the cost and complexity of any such sales), and such valuation shall be final and conclusive upon the Majority Vote of the Members via a vote occurring through the Dapp and the DAO's underlying smart contracts.

The Service Provider may, but is not obligated to, recommend to the Members to apply any reasonable valuation policies to calculate the value of DAO assets or DAO Investments (including methods for the valuation of: illiquid investments, discounts and marketability of tokens to be vested or distributed, staking and yield-producing activities, and other valuation methods to support DAO Investments, etc.), provided that, the Members approve, or approve with modification, the Service Provider’s valuation policies via a vote occurring through the Dapp and the DAO’s underlying smart contracts.

If the Members acting by Majority Vote determine in good faith that it is in the interest of the DAO (whether for legal, tax, regulatory considerations, or otherwise), all or a part of the DAO’s or any Member’s participation in a DAO Investment may be structured or restructured outside of the DAO, including, without limitation, (i) by requiring some or all of the Members to make such investment through a partnership, a limited liability company, or an alternate investment vehicle (an "AIV") that shall invest (directly or indirectly via a special purpose  vehicle ("SPV")) in lieu of the DAO; or (ii) by causing all or any portion of the DAO’s investment in such   transaction to be made through an SPV and/or AIV.

(b)	Co-Investment. The DAO may offer any Member, any Member’s Affiliates, and/ or any other Person (including the Service Provider, its Affiliates, and their respective Representatives) the right to co-invest with the DAO (directly or indirectly) in any DAO Investment. For the avoidance of doubt, the DAO (a) shall not be obligated to offer any Member or any Affiliate thereof the right to co-invest with the DAO; (b) may offer such right to third parties and/or to some, but not all, Members or Affiliates thereof; and (c) may determine how to allocate any such co-investment opportunities as  determined by the Members acting by Majority Vote.

## ARTICLE VII

(a)	Limited Right to Withdraw Undeployed Capital. A Member may withdraw all or any portion of its Undeployed Capital at any time through notice provided to the DAO via the Dapp. The withdrawal shall be facilitated and executed, in part, using one or more smart contracts and shall be effective as of the date indicated by the withdrawing Member in the notice provided to the DAO via the Dapp.
 
(i)	Each date on which a Member may withdraw all or any portion of its Undeployed Capital is referred to herein as a "Withdrawal Date."

(iii)	The Units of a Member to be withdrawn shall remain invested in the DAO after such Member has given notice of its intention to withdraw and until the Withdrawal Date (if different from the date on which the withdrawal notice is provided via the Dapp). Following such Withdrawal Date, the number of Units held by such Member and such Member’s Capital Commitment shall be proportionally reduced to reflect the withdrawal of such applicable portion of such Member’s Undeployed Capital.

(iv)	Payments of withdrawal proceeds shall be facilitated by one or more smart contracts executed, in part, via the Dapp. Notwithstanding the foregoing regarding the payment of withdrawal proceeds or anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, the applicable Service Provider may establish limited reserves and holdbacks for estimated DAO Expenses, liabilities, and/or contingencies attributable to any period prior to the applicable Withdrawal Date, including general reserves for unspecified contingencies, which will reduce the amount of a distribution upon withdrawal.

(v)	Any withdrawal is irrevocable and may only be rescinded with the consent of the Members acting by Majority Vote (excluding the Member seeking to rescind such withdrawal notice). Any transaction expenses that are incurred by the DAO with respect to such revoked withdrawal request, may be charged to such Member as determined by the Members acting by Majority Vote (excluding the rescinding Member).

(b)	No Other Withdrawal Rights. Except as set forth in Section 7.a, or as otherwise agreed in writing by the Members acting by Majority Vote (other than the Member seeking to withdraw), no Member shall have the right to withdraw its capital or profits from the DAO, or to demand and receive any DAO property, in exchange for such Member’s Units in the DAO. Each Member acknowledges and agrees that DAO Investments are illiquid.

(c)	Compulsory Withdrawal. Not in limitation of Section 4.d, upon written notice delivered to such Member, the Members acting by Majority Vote may cause a Member to be compulsorily withdrawn from the DAO to the extent that such Members, in their reasonable discretion, determine it to be necessary, desirable, or appropriate, including, without limitation, to comply with applicable law or regulations, or to avoid a material adverse effect on the DAO or the other Members.   For the avoidance of doubt, the Member proposed to be compulsorily withdrawn shall be entitled to vote with respect to any vote of the Members regarding such compulsory withdrawal.

(ii)	DAO Expenses shall be allocated to and funded by the Members pro rata in accordance with their relative Capital Commitments; provided, that DAO Expenses attributable to a DAO Investment will be allocated to and fund by only those Members participating in such DAO Investment, pro rata in accordance with their relative Capital Commitments invested in such DAO Investment. With respect to a DAO Investment for which any AIV or SPV is formed, the DAO Expenses attributable to such AIV or SPV shall be allocated to and funded by only those Members who participate in such AIV or SPV. The Members, acting by Majority Vote, also may determine that any one or more DAO Expenses shall be allocated on an alternative basis, provided that such alternative basis is more equitable.

(b)	Distributions in Kind. Each class of securities to be distributed in kind shall be distributed to the Members in proportion to their respective share of the proposed distribution, as provided in this ARTICLE IX, or in Section 12.b, as the case may be, except to the extent that a disproportionate distribution of such securities is necessary to avoid distributing fractional shares.

(d)	Tax Withholding. If the DAO incurs any obligation to pay any amount in respect of taxes (including withholding taxes and/or any interest, penalties, or additions to tax) imposed on income of or distributions made to any Member or former Member, any amount so required to be paid by the DAO with respect to such Person shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as if it had been loaned to such Person, and the applicable Service Provider shall give prompt written notice to such Person of the date and amount of such loan. Each Member covenants, for itself, its successors, assigns, heirs, and personal representatives, that such Person shall pay to the DAO at any time after notice of the loan has been given, but not later than five (5) Business Days after the applicable Service Provider delivers a written demand to such Person for such repayment (which demand may be made at any time prior to or after the dissolution of the DAO or the withdrawal of such Person or its predecessors from the DAO); provided, however, that if any such repayment is not made within such five (5) Business Day period: (i) such Person  shall pay interest to the DAO at a rate equal to eight percent (8%) for the entire period commencing on  the date on which the DAO paid such amount and ending on the date on which such Person repays such amount to the DAO together with all accrued but previously unpaid interest; and (ii) the DAO as determined by the Members by Majority Vote may (a) collect such unpaid amounts (including interest) from any DAO distributions that otherwise would be made to such Person.

(e)	Certain Distributions Prohibited. Notwithstanding anything in this ARTICLE IX to the contrary notwithstanding: (a) no distribution shall be made to any Member if, and to the extent that, such distribution would not be permitted under the Delaware Act; and (b) no distribution shall be made to any Member to the extent that such distribution, if made, would cause the deficit balance in the Capital Account of such Member.

(f)	No Reinvestment of Distributable Proceeds (No Recycling). For the avoidance of doubt, unless otherwise determined by Members acting by Majority Vote, the DAO shall not reinvest (or retain for investment) any Distributable Proceeds to effect DAO Investments, but shall be permitted to
 
retain Distributable Proceeds to pay DAO Expenses or to fund reserves for reasonably anticipated DAO Expenses, liabilities, or reserves.

(g)	No Recall of Distributions. Distributions shall not be recalled from the Members.

## ARTICLE X

### 10.	Capital Accounts; Allocations.

(a)	Capital Accounts. A Capital Account shall be established and maintained for each Member in accordance with the following provisions:

(i)	To each Member’s Capital Account, there shall be credited such Member’s capital contributions, such Member’s distributive share of Profits, and any items in the nature of income or gain that are specially allocated pursuant to this Agreement, and the amount of any liabilities  of the DAO that are assumed by such Member, or that are secured by any assets of the DAO distributed to such Member.

(ii)	To each Member’s Capital Account, there shall be debited the amount of cash and the Gross Asset Value of any DAO assets distributed to such Member pursuant to any provision of this Agreement, such Member’s distributive share of Losses, and any items in the nature of expenses or losses that are specially allocated pursuant to this Agreement, and the amount of any liabilities of such Member assumed by the DAO or that are secured by any property contributed by such Member to the DAO.

(iii)	If ownership of any Unit in the DAO is assigned in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the assignee shall succeed to the Capital Account of the assignor to the extent it relates to the assigned Unit.

(iv)	In determining the amount of any liability for purposes of Subsections
10.a.i and 10.a.ii above, there shall be taken into account Code Section 752(c) and any other applicable provisions of the Code and Treasury Regulations.

(v)	To each Member’s Capital Account, there shall be debited or credited, as the case may be, such adjustments as are necessary to reflect a revaluation of DAO assets to reflect the Gross Asset Value of all DAO assets, as required by Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) and Section
9.b hereof.

The foregoing provisions and the other provisions of this Agreement relating to the maintenance of Capital Accounts are intended to comply with Code Section 704 and Regulations Section 1.704-1(b) and shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such Regulations. The DAO shall make any adjustments that are necessary or appropriate to maintain equality between the Capital Accounts of the Members and the amount of DAO capital reflected on the DAO’s balance sheet as computed for book purposes in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(q).

(b)	Revaluations of DAO Property. The "Gross Asset Value" of any asset of the DAO shall be equal to the asset’s adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes, except as follows:
 
(i)	The initial Gross Asset Value of any asset contributed by a Member to the DAO shall be the gross fair market value of such asset, as determined by the contributing Member and  the Members (other than the contributing Member) by Majority Vote.

(ii)	The Gross Asset Values of all DAO assets shall be adjusted to equal their respective gross fair market values in connection with (and to be effective immediately prior to) the following events: (i) the acquisition of an additional Units in the DAO by any new or existing Member in exchange for more than a de minimis capital contribution; (ii) the distribution by the DAO to a Member of more than a de minimis amount of property (including cash) as consideration for an interest in the DAO;
(iii)	the grant of an interest in the DAO (other than a de minimis interest) as consideration for the provision of services to or for the benefit of the DAO by an existing Member acting in the capacity of a Member or by a new Member acting in the capacity of a Member or in anticipation of being a Member; or (iv) the liquidation of the DAO within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g); provided, however, that an adjustment pursuant to clauses (i), (ii), or (iii) above shall be made only if such adjustment is necessary or appropriate to reflect the relative economic interests of the Members in the DAO.

(iii)	The Gross Asset Value of any DAO asset distributed to any Member shall be the gross fair market value of such asset on the date of distribution.

(iv)	The Gross Asset Values of DAO assets shall be increased (or decreased) to reflect any adjustments to the adjusted bases of such assets pursuant to Code Section 734(b) or Code Section 743(b), but only to the extent that such adjustments are taken into account in determining Capital Accounts pursuant to Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m) and Section 10.a hereof; provided, however, that Gross Asset Values shall not be adjusted pursuant to this Subsection to the extent they were  adjusted pursuant to Subsections 9.b above, in connection with a transaction that otherwise would result in  an adjustment pursuant to this Subsection.

(v)	If the Gross Asset Value of an asset has been determined or adjusted pursuant to this Section 9.b, such Gross Asset Value shall thereafter be adjusted by the Depreciation taken into account with respect to such asset for purposes of computing Profits and Losses.

(c)	Allocations of Net Profit or Loss. After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in Section 11.a and subject to the other provisions of ARTICLE XI, Profits or Losses for any Accounting Period shall be allocated among the Members in such a manner that as closely as possible gives economic effect to the provisions in ARTICLE IX.

## ARTICLE XI

### 11.	Tax and Regulatory Allocations.

(a)	Special Allocations. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.c or any other provision of this Agreement, the Members shall have the discretion to modify the allocations of profits and losses, and all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit in such manner as the Members shall determine to be necessary or appropriate to comply with the Code section 704 and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

(b)	Code Section 704(c). The Members shall make such allocations for tax purposes, and any modifications to this Agreement, as may be required to comply with Code section 704(c) and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.
 
(c)	Other Allocation Rules.

(i)	Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, items of taxable income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit shall be allocated among the Members for income tax purposes in a manner consistent with the allocations made for "book purposes" under Section 10.c and this ARTICLE XI. Taxable income or loss for any accounting period that is not allocated pursuant to the preceding sentence and that is not otherwise allocated pursuant to Section 10.c or this ARTICLE XI shall be allocated among the Members for tax purposes in the same proportion that profit or loss has been allocated for that accounting period under Section 10.c.

(ii)	Notwithstanding the other provisions of Section 10.c or this ARTICLE XI, the Members are authorized to make any adjustment in the allocation of profits or losses provided for therein if the Members consider in good faith that the adjustment is necessary and equitable address issues not specifically dealt with therein to correct errors in allocations caused by errors in unaudited financial information or to correct inequities that may arise under this Agreement.

## ARTICLE XII

### 12.	Dissolution of the Membership.

(a)	General.

(i)	The DAO shall be dissolved and its affairs shall be wound up upon the earliest to occur of:

(1)	a determination of the Members by Majority Vote, with the prior written consent of the Service Provider;

(2)	the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution pursuant to the
Delaware Act; or

(3)	following disposition of all of the assets of the DAO.

(ii)	At dissolution, the DAO’s assets shall be liquidated in an orderly manner. A Person appointed by the Members acting by Majority Vote shall be the liquidator to wind up the affairs of the DAO, pursuant to this Agreement. Any such liquidator shall be a "liquidating trustee" within the meaning of the Delaware Act.

(iii)	The DAO shall not be dissolved in the event of the dissolution, death, bankruptcy, insolvency, incompetence, disability, substitution, or admission of any Member, or any other similar event involving the existence, status, or organization of a Member.

(b)	Liquidating Distributions. The liquidator(s) shall pay, or provide for the satisfaction of, the DAO’s liabilities and obligations to creditors, or reasonable provisions shall be made for such satisfaction and there shall be withheld such reserves as are required by applicable law and such other reserves established in the sole and absolute discretion of the liquidator(s). In performing their duties, the liquidator(s) are authorized to sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of the assets of the DAO, in such reasonable manner as the liquidator(s) shall determine to be in the best interests of the Members. Any Profit or Loss or other items realized in connection with the liquidation of the DAO’s assets shall be allocated among the Members pursuant to ARTICLE X, and the remaining assets of the DAO shall be distributed to the Members in cash (to the extent feasible), in kind, or in cryptocurrency in accordance with the applicable distribution provisions of ARTICLE IX.

(c)	Reserves.

(i)	A Member’s right to distributions shall not be reduced by an amount on account of any contingency, transaction, or claim until its final settlement or such earlier time as the liquidator(s) shall determine, in its reasonable discretion. The DAO may retain from sums otherwise due such Member an amount that the liquidator(s) estimates to be sufficient to cover the share of such Member of any probable loss or liability on account of such contingency or the probable value of the transaction or claim. Any unused portion of such reserve shall be distributed (without interest accrued thereon) after the liquidator(s) shall have determined that the need therefor shall have ceased.

(ii)	Upon determination by the liquidator(s) that circumstances no longer require the retention of sums as provided in Section 12.c, the liquidator(s) shall, at the earliest practicable time, pay such sums or distribute such assets or the proceeds realized from the sale of such assets to each Member from which such sums or assets have been withheld.

(d)	Expenses of Liquidator(s). The expenses incurred by the liquidator(s) in connection with winding up the DAO, all other losses or liabilities of the DAO incurred in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and reasonable compensation for the services of the liquidator(s) shall be borne by the DAO.

(e)	Duration of Liquidation.   A reasonable time shall be allowed for the winding up of the affairs of the DAO, in order to minimize any losses otherwise attendant upon such winding up. The liquidator(s) shall use its reasonable best efforts to carry out the liquidation in conformity with the timing requirements of Treasury Regulation section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g), but shall not be bound to do so, or liable in any way to any Member for failure to do so.

(f)	No Liability for Return of Capital. The liquidator(s), the Service Provider, the Members, their respective Affiliates, and their respective Representatives shall not be personally liable for the return of the capital contributions of any Member. No Member shall be obligated to restore to the DAO any amount with respect to a negative Capital Account; provided, however, that this provision in no way shall affect the obligations of Members to make their-agreed-upon capital contributions and other required payments to the DAO.

(g)	Goodwill and Intangible Assets. In making any determination of the fair value of the assets of the DAO, no allowance of any kind shall be made for goodwill or of the DAO’s office records, files, and statistical data, or any intangible assets of the DAO in the nature of or similar to goodwill.

## ARTICLE XIII

### 13.	Limitations on Transfers.

(a)	Transfers of Units. No assignment, pledge, mortgage, hypothecation, gift, sale, or other disposition or encumbrance of (collectively, "Transfer") of Units, in whole or in part, shall be made, other than pursuant to this Section 13.a, except for a Transfer made pursuant to Section 13.c.v. Any attempted Transfer of all or any part of Units without compliance with this Agreement shall be null and
 
void. Every Transfer shall be subject to all of the terms, conditions, restrictions, and obligations set forth in this Agreement. Unless the Members determine via a Majority Vote that interests in the DAO are not a security under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any other applicable securities laws, including the Investment Company Act, the prior written consent of the Members (other than the Member seeking to Transfer) by Majority Vote shall be required for any Transfer of part or all of any Member’s Units; provided, that any Member may Transfer its Units to any other then-current Member without such consent, subject to the Ownership Percentage Restriction. Members may vote to allow or disallow the ability of Members to transfer their Units via a vote occurring through the Dapp. Each Transfer shall be evidenced by a written agreement that is executed by the transferor and the transferee(s), and that includes such representations of the transferor and the transferee as the Members shall request.

(b)	Required Reimbursement and Indemnification. The transferor of any interest in the DAO hereby agrees to reimburse the DAO for any expenses reasonably incurred by the DAO in connection with such Transfer, including any legal, accounting, and other expenses ("Transfer Expenses"), whether or not such Transfer is consummated. If the transferor has not reimbursed the DAO for any Transfer Expenses incurred by the DAO in consummating a Transfer within five (5) Business Days after the Service Provider has delivered to such Member written demand for payment, the Service Provider may cause the DAO to reduce the transferee’s right to distributions by any such Transfer Expenses. In addition, the transferor and transferee shall indemnify the DAO and the Service Provider against any loss, claim, damage or liability to which such party may become subject arising out of, related to, or in connection with any false representation or warranty made by, or breach or failure to comply with any covenant or agreement of, such transferring Member or such transferee.

(c)	Admission of Substituted Members.

(i)	Any transferee of Units transferred in accordance with the provisions of this ARTICLE XIII shall be admitted as a substituted Member.

(ii)	The DAO shall not recognize for any purpose any purported Transfer of all or any part of a Member’s Units in the DAO, and no purchaser, assignee, transferee, or other recipient of all or any part of such Units shall become a substituted Member hereunder unless:

(1)	the provisions of Sections 13.a through  13.b shall have been
complied with;

(2)	the Service Provider is furnished with the documents effecting such Transfer, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Service Provider, executed and acknowledged by both the seller, assignor, or transferor and the purchaser, assignee, transferee, or other recipient;

(3)	such purchaser, assignee, transferee, or other recipient shall have represented that such Transfer was made in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations;

(4)	to the extent required by the Service Provider, in its sole and absolute discretion, the transferor shall have provided an opinion of counsel, satisfactory in form and substance to the Service Provider, to the effect that such Transfer shall not violate the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any other applicable securities laws, including the Investment Company Act;
 
(5)	such Transfer, alone or together with any other Transfers, shall not cause the DAO to be a "publicly traded partnership" under Code Section 7704 and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder; and

(6)	all necessary governmental consents and acknowledgments (if any) shall have been obtained in respect of such Transfer.

(iii)	In addition, no transfer shall be permitted until the DAO is provided with such information establishing that the DAO will not have a requirement to withhold under Code Section 1446(f) as a result of the transfer, as the Service Provider reasonably determines.

(iv)	The transferee of Units transferred pursuant to this ARTICLE XIII that is admitted to the DAO as a substituted Member shall succeed to the rights and liabilities of the transferor Member with respect to such transferred Units and, after the effective date of such admission, the Capital Commitment, capital contributions, and Capital Account of the transferor with respect to such transferred Units shall become the Capital Commitment, capital contributions, and Capital Account, respectively, of the transferee, to the extent of the Units transferred.

(v)	Permitted Transfers.	The provisions of Section 13.c.ii and Section
13.c	.iii shall not apply to a Transfer approved by the Service Provider, of all or any part of a Member’s Units in the DAO, in accordance with this Section and the following requirements:

(1)	the Service Provider confirms that the transferee is an entity  under the majority control or affiliated by the transferor Member;

(2)	the Service Provider is furnished with the acceptable documents effectuating such Transfer, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Service Provider, executed and acknowledged by both the seller, assignor, or transferor and the purchaser, assignee, transferee, or other recipient;

(3)	the transferee entity itself passes all necessary Know Your Customer and/or Anti-Money Laundering and other accreditation requirements that the Service Provider, in its absolute discretion, deems necessary; and

(4)	the Service Provider, transferor Member, and transferee Member effect the Transfer of Units under this Section in accordance with the other relevant requirements of ARTICLE XIII’s provisions, other than those omitted or excepted ("Permitted Transfers").

(d)	Effect of Death, Dissolution, or Bankruptcy. Upon the death, incompetence, bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or dissolution of a Member, the rights and obligations of that Member under this Agreement shall accrue to that Member’s successor(s), estate, or legal representative, and each such Person shall be treated as an unadmitted transferee of that Member’s Units, as described in the Delaware Act, unless and until admitted as a Member by Members acting by a Majority Vote.

(e)	Drag-Along Rights.

(i)	Drag Along Sale. If one or more Members (the "Dragging Members") desires to effect any Transfer of Units representing in excess of seventy-five percent (75%) of the Units to any Person(s) through any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, pursuant to a purchase of Units, tender offer, other business combination transaction, or otherwise), then
 
the Members acting by a Majority Vote, may require each non-Dragging Member (each, a " Drag Along Member") to sell the Drag Along Percentage of the Units held by such Drag Along Member, on the same terms and conditions as apply to the Units to be sold by the Dragging Members, and/or to vote in favor of such sale of assets, as applicable. "Drag Along Percentage" means a fraction expressed as a percentage
(x)	the numerator of which is the aggregate Units being sold by the Dragging Members in such applicable transaction(s); and (y) the denominator of which is the total Units held by the Dragging Members at the time of such applicable transaction(s). A "Drag Along Sale" means a transfer of interests described in the first sentence of this Section 13.e.

(ii)	Drag Along Notice; Drag Along Consideration. The Dragging Members shall give written notice to all of the Drag Along Members disclosing in reasonable detail (i) the Units to be subject to the Drag Along Sale; (ii) the proposed amount and type of consideration and the material terms and conditions of payment that the Dragging Members intend to accept; and (iii) the name and address of the prospective purchaser. The consideration paid in connection with a Drag Along Sale shall be paid to the applicable Drag Along Members participating in such Drag Along Sale on the same terms and conditions as the Dragging Members.

(iii)	DAO Transactions. If the Members by a Majority Vote desire to effect any merger, business combination, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the DAO, to the extent  that a vote of the Members is required, each Member agrees to vote in support of such transaction (a Drag  Along Sale or any such merger, business combination, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the  DAO, a "Drag Along Transaction").

(iv)	Drag Along Support. Each Member agrees to cooperate to effect any Drag Along Transaction expeditiously, and to execute and deliver all documents necessary or reasonably requested in connection with such Drag Along Transaction, and enter into any instrument, undertaking, or obligation necessary or reasonably requested in connection with such Drag Along Transaction. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 13.e and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Member shall take or cause to be taken all reasonable actions, and do, or cause to be done, on behalf and in respect of the DAO any and all actions, that may be reasonably requested consistent with this Section 13.e in connection with any Drag Along Transaction. In addition, if requested by the Dragging Members or applicable purchaser in connection with a Drag Along Sale, each Drag Along Member shall execute  and deliver a definitive purchase and sale agreement, in substantially the same form and substance as the definitive agreement executed and delivered by the Dragging Members; provided, however (i) that any indemnification obligation of any Drag Along Member in connection with the sale shall be several and not joint, and (ii) the Drag Along Members shall only be obligated to make such representations and warranties with respect to himself, herself, or itself (as opposed to the business and condition of the other Members or the DAO).

(v)	Irrevocable Proxy.   Solely for purposes of this Section 13.e and in order to secure the performance of each Member’s obligations under this Section 13.e, each Member hereby irrevocably appoints the Service Provider as the attorney-in-fact and proxy of such Member (with full power of substitution) to vote, provide a written consent, or take any other action with respect to such Member’s Units in connection with such Drag Along Transaction.   This power of attorney and proxy shall be irrevocable and coupled with an interest sufficient at law to create an irrevocable proxy and  power of attorney, and each Member shall take such further action and execute such other instruments as may be necessary to effectuate the intent of this power of attorney or proxy and hereby revokes any  power of attorney and proxy previously granted by it with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 13.e with respect to the Units owned by such Member. The proxy and power of attorney granted hereby is attached to the Units in connection with such Drag Along Transaction owned by such Member and  shall be binding upon any holder thereof, and shall survive the duration of this Agreement.

(f)	Tag Along Rights.

(i)	If one or Members representing in excess of seventy-five percent (75%) of the Units (the "Tag Offeror") proposes to make a Transfer, directly or indirectly, to one or more Persons (other than an Affiliate of such Member or solely for tax or trusts and estates planning purposes) ("Tag Purchaser"), in one or more series of related transactions, other than a transaction in which the Drag  Along Members have exercised rights pursuant to Section 13.e, then each other Member (each, a "Tagging Member") shall have tag-along rights with respect to such Tagging Member’s Units, as set forth  herein (the "Tag-Along Rights"). "Tag Along Percentage" means a fraction expressed as a percentage (x)  the numerator of which is the aggregate Units being sold by the Tag Offeror(s) in such applicable transaction(s); and (y) the denominator of which is the total Units held by the Tag Offeror(s) at the time  of such applicable transaction(s).

(ii)	If circumstances occur which give rise to the Tag-Along Rights, the Tag Offeror shall provide written notice to each of the other Members not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the closing of the proposed Transfer. A Tagging Member may exercise the Tag-Along Rights by giving written notice to the Service Provider and the Tag Offeror at least ten (10) days prior to the closing of the proposed Transfer, and such written notice shall state the portion of his, her, or its Units that such Member wishes to sell, up to the Tag Along Percentage of such Member’s Units. If the Tag Purchaser decline(s) to purchase all of the Units of the Tag Offeror and each Tagging Member, the applicable Units to be sold by each Tag Offeror and each Tagging Member shall be reduced on a proportionate basis. Each Tagging Member shall be obligated to sell the applicable portion of his, her, or its Units identified in such Tagging Member’s written acceptance (as may be reduced pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence) for the consideration and upon substantially similar terms by which the Tag Offerors are selling to the Tag Purchaser, such obligation to be conditioned upon and contemporaneous with completion of the transaction of purchase and sale with the Tag Offeror.

## ARTICLE XIV

### 14.	Books and Records; Accounting and Tax Matters.

(a)	Maintenance of Records; Inspection.

(i)	At all times, the Service Provider shall cause to be kept proper and complete books of account in which shall be entered fully and accurately the transactions of the DAO, and which may be maintained via the Dapp or available via block explorers on the [[Blockchain Name]] network. All decisions as to accounting principles, accounting methods, and other accounting matters shall be made by the Members acting by Majority Vote.

(ii)	Subject to ARTICLE XVI, books and records of the DAO that are not otherwise available via the Dapp shall be available, upon reasonable advance notice to the Service Provider, for inspection at the location determined by the Service Provider (or digitally, if determined by the Service Provider, in its sole discretion) at reasonable times during ordinary business hours on any Business Day by each Member or its duly authorized agents or representatives solely to the extent permitted by the Act, including for a purpose reasonably related to such Member’s Units in the DAO. Each Member agrees that (i) such books and records contain confidential information relating to the DAO  and its affairs, and (ii) the Service Provider shall have the right, except as prohibited by the Delaware Act,  to prohibit or otherwise limit, in its reasonable discretion, the making of any copies of such books and  records.

(b)	Schedules K-1. The Service Provider shall transmit to each Member such Member’s Schedule K-1 (Internal Revenue Service Form 1065), indicating such Member’s share of all items of income or gain, expense, loss, or other deduction, and tax credit of the DAO for such year, as well as the status of its Capital Account as of the end of such year, and such additional information as it reasonably may request to enable it to complete its tax returns or to fulfill any other reporting requirement.

(c)	Tax Elections; Accounting and Related Determinations. The Members acting by Majority Vote shall be empowered to make or revoke any election now or hereafter required or permitted to be made by the Code or any state or local tax law, and to decide in a fair and equitable manner all accounting procedures and other matters arising with respect to the DAO or under this Agreement that are not expressly provided for in this Agreement.

(d)	Accounting Provisions. The fiscal year of the DAO shall be the calendar year, or such other year as may be required by the Code. The DAO shall use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The DAO’s independent public accountants shall be a recognized independent public accounting firm selected by the Members acting by Majority Vote.

(e)	Partnership Audit Rules.

(i)	The Service Provider is designated the Partnership Representative; provided, that the Service Provider may elect to appoint a different Partnership Representative in accordance with the applicable Treasury Regulations upon the approval of the Members by Majority Vote. With respect to any period in which any non-individual is the Partnership Representative, the DAO shall appoint an individual eligible to be a "designated individual" under the Partnership Audit Rules (the "Designated Individual") through whom the Partnership Representative shall act for all purposes of the Partnership Audit Rules. The DAO is hereby authorized to take any actions necessary under the  Partnership Audit Rules or other guidance to designate the Partnership Representative and appoint the Designated Individual with respect to each taxable year of the DAO (and the Partnership Representative and the Designated Individual are authorized to take any actions specified under the Partnership Audit Rules or any applicable state statute or local law). In exercising its authority as DAO Partnership or the Designated Individual under the Partnership Audit rules, the Tax Representative shall at all times be subject to the direction of the Members acting by Majority Vote.

(ii)	Each Member shall indemnify and hold the Partnership Representative and the Designated Individual (collectively, the "Tax Representative"), and the DAO harmless for such Member’s respective portion of the financial burden of any "imputed underpayment" (as determined  under Code Section 6225) and associated interest, adjustments to tax and penalties arising from a  company-level adjustment that are imposed on the DAO. In furtherance thereof, each Member agrees (A)  to pay such amount to the DAO within fifteen (15) days following the DAO’s request for payment (and any failure to pay such amount shall result in interest on such amount calculated at the prime rate plus two  percent (2%) and (B) that any amounts otherwise distributable to such Member may be applied in satisfaction of such obligations. Except with the express written consent of the Members acting by Majority Vote, each Member shall be jointly and severally liable with their predecessors in interest, if any, for amounts owed hereunder in respect of any predecessor in interest to such Member.
 
(iii)	By executing this Agreement or a counterpart hereof, each Member
(i)	expressly authorizes the Tax Representative and the DAO to take any and all action that is reasonably necessary under applicable federal income tax law (as such law may be revised from time to time) to cause the DAO to make the election set forth in Code Section 6226(a) if the Tax Representative decides  to make such election, and (ii) expressly agrees to take any action, and furnish the Tax Representative with any information necessary, to give effect to such election. No Member shall file a notice with the IRS under Code Section 6222(c)(1)(B) in connection with such Member’s intention to treat an item on such Member’s federal income tax return in a manner that is inconsistent with the treatment of such item on the DAO’s federal income tax return unless such Member has, not less than thirty (30) days prior to  the filing of such notice, provided the Tax Representative with a copy of the notice and thereafter in a timely manner provides such other information related thereto as the Tax Representative shall reasonably request.

(iv)	The fees and expenses incurred by the DAO in connection with any audit or investigation of the DAO, and all subsequent administrative and judicial proceedings arising out of such audit, including, without limitation tax counsel to the DAO, and all expenses incurred by the Tax Representative in serving as such, shall be DAO Expenses and shall be paid by the DAO. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall be the responsibility of each Member, at their expense, to employ tax counsel to represent their respective separate interests.

(v)	If the Tax Representative is required by law or regulation to incur fees and expenses in connection with tax matters not affecting each of the Members, then the Tax Representative may, in its reasonable discretion, seek reimbursement from those Members on whose behalf such fees and expenses were incurred or reduce the amount of distribution table to such Members.

(vi)	The provisions of this Section 14.e shall survive the termination of the DAO or the termination of any interests in the DAO and shall remain binding on the Members for as long a period of time as is necessary to resolve with the Internal Revenue Service any and all matters regarding the federal income taxation of the DAO or the Members (relating to the operations of the DAO).

## ARTICLE XV

### 15.	Indemnification; Waiver of Fiduciary Duties.

(a)	Indemnification.

(i)	The DAO is permitted, to the extent required by any applicable agreement, to indemnify the Service Providers to the DAO, including the Initial Service Provider and any liquidating trustee. Further, with respect to the disposition of DAO Investments and pursuant to any applicable transaction agreement, to the extent required, the DAO shall indemnify the buyers of DAO Investments in certain circumstances.

(ii)	Except as expressly set forth in this ARTICLE XV, in the event that any Member initiates any Proceeding against the DAO and a judgment or order not subject to further appeal or discretionary review is rendered in respect of such Proceeding, as the case may be, such Member shall be solely liable for all costs and expenses related to the Proceeding.

(b)	Limitation by Law. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to provide for the indemnification for any liability to the extent (but only to the extent) that such indemnification
 
would be in violation of applicable law, but instead shall be construed so as to effectuate the provisions thereof to the fullest extent permitted by law.

(c)	Waiver of Fiduciary Duties. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law (including Section 18-1101 of the Act), notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or  otherwise of applicable law, including any in equity or at law, no Member shall have any fiduciary duty  to the DAO or any Member by reason of this Agreement or in its capacity as a Member, except that the Members shall be subject to the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they restrict or eliminate the duties and liabilities of the Members otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the parties hereto to replace such other duties and liabilities of the Members.
